      Quito, created by the Spanish Crown in 1563, were established here in 1612.
      By the mid-18th century, these houses were demolished, and other properties
      were added. A new building was erected over an atrium with a parapet, occupying
      the entire plaza front. After independence, it became the seat of the republican
      government. \n\nIt has been known since the 1970s as the Carondelet Palace,
      in memory of Luis Francisco H\xE9ctor Baron of Carondelet, the 29th president
      of the Royal Court, who governed from 1799 to 1807.\n\nDuring the administration
      of Camilo Ponce Enr\xEDquez, between 1956 and 1960, a major reconstruction
      of the building was carried out, part of which can be seen today.\n"

      indigenous people taken by force, crossed the eastern Andes mountain range
      and entered the dense jungle. On February 12, 1542, Captain Francisco de Orellana,
      separated from the expedition, reached the R\xEDo Mar and, unable to return,
      sailed to its mouth in the Atlantic, later reporting his discovery to the Crown.
      They called it the Amazon River because, at some point along its course, they
      were supposedly attacked by a tribe of warrior women who reminded them of the
      Amazons of Greek mythology."
